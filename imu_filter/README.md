# imu_filter

This is a project that uses IMU filter algorithm in ROS(Robot Operating System). The IMU I use is ICM 20602, consisting of a tri-axis gyroscope and a tri-axis accelerometer.

## ROS API  
### Subscribed Topics
Message containing raw IMU data, including angular velocities and linear accelerations.</br>
`imu0`(sensor_msgs/Imu) 
### Published Topics
The fused pose representation.</br>
`quaternion`(geometry_msg/QuaternionStamped)</br>
`ypr`(geometry_msgs/Vector3Stamped)  
## Parameters
### Dynamically Reconfigurable Parameters</br>
(Mahony_filter)  `twoKp` `twoKi`</br>
(Madgwick_filter) `beta`</br>
To tune the dynamic parameters after runnig the node, input

    rosrun rqt_configure rqt_reconfigure
According to Madgwick's thesis, the suggested beta = sqrt(3.0f / 4.0f) * gyroMeasError. ICM20602's gyroscope 
sensitivity erroris Â±1%. Thus the default beta is setting to 0.1088. As the specific application, the value
can be tuned accoring to response and requriments.
### Non-dynamically Reconfigurable Parameters </br>
`sampleFreq`(float, default: 400.0)</br>
You can change its value at the beginning, Such as: 
          
    rosrun filter Madgwick_filter _sampleFreq:=200
## provied tf Transforms
odom -> imu  
So you can open rviz and set the fixed frame "odom", add TF then you can use it to verify the effect directly.

## Result
The Madgwick_filter node's effect is acceptable, but the Mahony_filter is disappointing.
